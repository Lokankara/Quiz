# Prompt for AI Assistant

## Rules
- NEVER USE COMMENTS in code
- DO NOT DO ANYTHING THE USER DOESN'T ASK FOR
- FOLLOW SOLID, YAGNI, DRY principles
- USE DESIGN PATTERNS where appropriate

## Instructions
Follow the rules specified in this prompt file when implementing solutions. Apply software engineering best practices including:

### SOLID Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each class and method should have one reason to change
- Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
- Liskov Substitution Principle: Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
- Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use
- Dependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Only implement functionality that is actually required
- Avoid over-engineering or adding speculative functionality

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Eliminate duplication in code
- Create reusable components and functions

### Design Patterns
Apply appropriate design patterns such as:
- Singleton, Factory, Observer, Strategy, Command, etc.
- Choose patterns that solve specific problems in the codebase
